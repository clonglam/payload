To use Payload with MongoDB, install the package `@payloadcms/db-mongodb`. It will come with everything you need to
store your Payload data in MongoDB.

Then from there, pass it to your Payload Config as follows:

```ts
import { mongooseAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb'

export default buildConfig({
  // Your config goes here
  collections: [
    // Collections go here
  ],
  // Configure the Mongoose adapter here
  db: mongooseAdapter({
    // Mongoose-specific arguments go here.
    // URL is required.
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
  }),
})
```

## Options

| Option               | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `autoPluralization`  | Tell Mongoose to auto-pluralize any collection names if it encounters any singular words used as collection `slug`s. |
| `schemaOptions`      | Customize schema options for all Mongoose schemas created internally.   |
| `collections`        | Options on a collection-by-collection basis. [More](#collections-options)  |
| `globals`            | Options for the Globals collection created by Payload. [More](#globals-options) |
| `connectOptions`     | Customize MongoDB connection options. Payload will connect to your MongoDB database using default options which you can override and extend to include all the [options](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#options) available to mongoose. |
| `disableIndexHints`  | Set to true to disable hinting to MongoDB to use 'id' as index. This is currently done when counting documents for pagination, as it increases the speed of the count function used in that query. Disabling this optimization might fix some problems with AWS DocumentDB. Defaults to false |
| `migrationDir`       | Customize the directory that migrations are stored. |
| `transactionOptions` | An object with configuration properties used in [transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/) or `false` which will disable the use of transactions. |

## Access to Mongoose models

After Payload is initialized, this adapter exposes all of your Mongoose models and they are available for you to work
with directly.

You can access Mongoose models as follows:

- Collection models - `payload.db.collections[myCollectionSlug]`
- Globals model - `payload.db.globals`
- Versions model (both collections and globals) - `payload.db.versions[myEntitySlug]`

### Collections Options

You can configure the way the MongoDB adapter works on a collection-by-collection basis, including customizing Mongoose `schemaOptions` for each collection schema created.

Example:

```ts
const db = mongooseAdapter({
  url: 'your-url-here',
  collections: {
    users: {
      // 
      schemaOptions: {
        strict: false,
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Global Options

Payload automatically creates a single `globals` collection that correspond with any Payload globals that you define. When you initialize the `mongooseAdapter`, you can specify settings here for your globals in a similar manner to how you can for collections above. Right now, the only property available is `schemaOptions` but more may be added in the future.
